In theory, removing the OLPF altogether should result in a higher resolution than the filtered 24MP sensors found in the D5200 and D3200 can produce. We saw Nikon test the waters in this regard with the 36MP D800E, in which the effect of the OLPF was 'cancelled out'. Based on our test results with that camera, we suspect that realizing benefits of the OLPF's omission will require some very good optics at optimum apertures. The downside is, of course, greater potential for moir√©-induced artifacts when shooting stills of objects with fine patterned detail. </p>			<h2 id="feat">Features</h2>			<ul>				<li>24.1 effective megapixel CMOS, Nikon DX format image sensor, without an optical low-pass filter.</li>				<li>Nikon EXPEED 3 image-processing engine.</li>				<li>Advanced Multi-CAM 3500DX autofocus sensor module with 51 focus points.</li>				<li>3D Color Matrix Metering II 2,016-pixel RGB sensor.</li>				<li>Center cross-type focus point supports autofocusing with lenses with a maximum aperture of f/8.</li>			</ul>		</div>		<div id="sidebar">			<h2 id="and">Advantages &amp; Disadvantages</h2>			<p> Although the D7100 has 24.1MP, while the D7000 has only 16.2MP, there are no significant improvement for the newer ones. DxOMark say is "just a smidge better in all regards". The D7100 also removed the Optical Low Pass Filter (OLPF), but compared with Nikon D5200 which has same 24.1MP sensor and still has OLPF, the difference is insignificant.</p>			<p>The sensor of the D7100 uses Nikons DX format, resulting in a crop factor of 1.5x. Additionally the software allows to add a crop of another 1.3x (resulting in about 1.95x compared to 35mm). Selecting this additional crop mode allows faster focusing in video mode and also enables interlaced video recording modes.</p>		</div>		<h3>Reference</h3>		<p> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D7100 </p>	</div>	</body></html>
